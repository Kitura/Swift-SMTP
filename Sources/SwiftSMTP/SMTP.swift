    ///     - password: Password to log in to server, or access token if using XOAUTH2 authorization method.
    ///     - port: Port to connect to the server on. Defaults to `465`.
    ///     - useTLS: `Bool` indicating whether to connect with TLS. Your server must support the `STARTTLS` command.
    ///       Defaults to `true`.
    ///     - tlsConfiguration: `TLSConfiguration` used to connect with TLS. If nil, a configuration with no backing
    ///       certificates is used. See `TLSConfiguration` for other configuration options.
    ///     - authMethods: `AuthMethod`s to use to log in to the server. If blank, tries all supported methods.
    ///     - domainName: Client domain name used when communicating with the server. Defaults to `localhost`.
